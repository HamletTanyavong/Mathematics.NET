# DG0001: Invalid Index Name Declaration

## Cause

An inde name was defined outside the scope of a namepace.

## How to Fix Violations

Place the index name in a namespace.

## Example

The following violates the rule:
```csharp
using Mathematics.NET.Core.Attributes;

[IndexName] public partial struct Alpha;
```
The following are valid:
```csharp
using Mathematics.NET.Core.Attributes;

namespace DG0001;

[IndexName] public partial struct Alpha;
```
and
```csharp
using Mathematics.NET.Core.Attributes;

namespace DG0001
{
    [IndexName] public partial struct Alpha;
}
```
