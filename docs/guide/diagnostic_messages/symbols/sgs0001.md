# SGS0001: Invalid Symbol Declaration

## Cause

A symbol was defined outside the scope of a namepace.

## How to Fix Violations

Place the symbol in a namespace.

## Example

The following violates the rule:
```csharp
using Mathematics.NET.Core.Attributes;

[Symbol] public partial struct Alpha;
```
The following are valid:
```csharp
using Mathematics.NET.Core.Attributes;

namespace SGS0001;

[Symbol] public partial struct Alpha;
```
and
```csharp
using Mathematics.NET.Core.Attributes;

namespace SGS0001
{
    [Symbol] public partial struct Alpha;
}
```
