# Samples

This folder contains sample code that helps demonstrate the features of Mathematics.NET. These are mostly file-based applications which can be run with the `dotnet run` command.[^1]

## Overview

Here is an overview of some of the available samples.

- [Samples.GradientTape](Samples.GradientTape.cs): How to use gradient tapes and find the gradient of multivariable functions.
- [Samples.OpenCLService.CompMatMul](Samples.OpenCLService.CompMatMul.cs): An experimental method that demonstrates matrix multilication of complex numbers on a GPU.
