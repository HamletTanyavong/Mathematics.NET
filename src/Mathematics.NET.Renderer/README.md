# Mathematics.NET Renderer

This is an experimental renderer for Mathematics.NET that will help with visualizing 2D and 3D plots.

## About

This project was inspired by Brendan Galea's [Vulkan game engine tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/@BrendanGalea/playlists) on YouTube and draws heavily from its concepts.[^1] The C# version of this tutorial was ported by [David Howard](https://github.com/stymee/SilkVulkanTutorial) and uses [Silk.NET](https://github.com/dotnet/Silk.NET). This project differs from the port in slight ways, one of which being code style.
